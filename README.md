# Darkest Hour Bot
A discord bot developed with java made specifically for Darkest Hour, a discord text-rpg server. This bot moderates chat, manages the server, and provides a unique rpg system. It uses the JDA (Java Discord API) developed by Austin Keener, Michael Ritter, and Florian Spie√ü, which can be found here: https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA

To be clear, its solely built for Darkest Hour, so its incompatible as-is for other servers. That being said, this project is unlicensed, meaning you're free to do whatever it is you see fit as long as you comply to the JDA license. This is the first official project I've started and the only one I'm working on (as of yet), and compounded with the fact that I'm still inexperienced to most aspects of programming and java, there will be many of face-palming errors. Knowing this, I very much appreciate any suggestions, tips, or general advice. Thanks!
