# Darkest Dawn Bot
A discord bot developed with java made specifically for Darkest Hour, a discord text-rpg server. It has then transitioned to its sequel server, Breaking Dawn. This bot moderates chat, manages the server, and provides unique RPG mechanics. It uses the JDA (Java Discord API) developed by Austin Keener, Michael Ritter, and Florian Spie√ü, which can be found here: https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA

To be clear, its solely built for Breaking Dawn, so its incompatible as-is for other servers. That being said, this project is Open Source, meaning you're free to do whatever it is you see fit as long as you comply to the JDA license.

This project has been dropped as I no longer am affiliated with Breaking Dawn nor Darkest Hour.
